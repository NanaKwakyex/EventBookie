Events can be hard to find and even harder to get tickets to sometimes. 
Often, people tend to go out, have fun, and experience new things. However this can end up being more of a stress builder than what they originally signed up for. This is because of the issue with being able to find events that are happening around you, trying to get tickets, as well as staying updated with any news with planned event. These struggles mentioned can deter people from attending community events and causes low attendance at events that otherwise wouldnâ€™t have an issue pulling a sizeable crowd. 


So we made a solution: Event Bookie, a event booking web application. 
By utilizing a event booking web application, the problems with discovering new events, finding tickets, and getting event information whether just about the details of the event or last minute updates. The web app would display different events (in a list format) going on within a general area, allowing users to get more event info after clicking into it.
ultimately delivering a seamless and user-centric solution for eventgoers and organizers alike. 


Our event booking platform has the potential to tap into a significant and growing industry, with millions of potential event-goers, event organizers, and a sizable existing market. We intend to capture a significant share of this market by addressing pain points in event discovery, ticket booking, and communication while providing a more user-centric and efficient alternative to existing solutions.
